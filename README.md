# Pomodoro Timer

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It encourages people to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique helps boost productivity by improving focus and preventing burnout. The name "Pomodoro" (Italian for tomato) comes from the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used during his university days.
